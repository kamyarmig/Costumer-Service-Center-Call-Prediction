# Costumer-Service-Center-Call-Prediction
The Goal of this code is to analyse and predict Costumer call number based on veriety of factor.
Following data set has been used:
United States is the largest country for “on the air” electrical distribution system.
This system has been developed while ago and needs day to day maintenance to provide sustainable electricity to customers. 
There are thousands of lineman in utility companies that maintain the grid operational.
Lineman are dispatched to the field by call centers that get information from consumer. 
The call centers gets huge number of calls all across the nation 24/7.
This big data is a good candidate to investigate and predict costumer’s needs based on different factors. 
As of today all of the calls are managed with traditional methods.
The goal of this project is to present a model for predicting call number for a call center in the
West coast which depends on time and date as well as climate status.
